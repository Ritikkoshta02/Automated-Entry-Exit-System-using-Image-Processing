# Automated-Entry-Exit-System-using-Image-Processing
 The entry-exit digitization system developed for IIT Guwahati features a sophisticated workflow leveraging YOLOv5 for ID card detection, followed by image capture, cropping, and alignment. A classification model identifies the type of card, enabling targeted extraction of details using PyTesseract for OCR. Face verification using real-time images and card images ensures authentication, supported by SQL database matching for identity validation. Valid entries are logged into an Excel sheet, providing a structured record of authorized access attempts and enhancing security and efficiency in access control processes within the campus environment.
